2025-2026 Web Development Standards for Otterdays
1. HTML Architecture (Semantic & Accessible)
Prioritize Semantic HTML: Always use semantic elements (<article>, <section>, <figure>, <figcaption>, <nav>, <aside>) over generic <div> structures to improve SEO and accessibility.
Modern Forms:
Use field-sizing: content for <textarea> elements to enable auto-resizing without JS.
For custom <select> dropdowns, use appearance: base-select to gain full styling control over options and triggers.
Internationalization: If adding multi-language support, use the direction attribute (ltr/rtl) on specific elements rather than global CSS overrides where possible.
Link Types: Use rel="preload" for critical assets and rel="prefetch" for likely next pages to optimize LCP (Largest Contentful Paint).
2. CSS Architecture (Modern 2025/2026 Features)
Adopt Native CSS Nesting: Stop using SCSS/Sass preprocessors for new stylesheets. Use native nesting syntax (& .child) to reduce build complexity and improve browser-native debugging.
Exception: Continue using SCSS only if existing mixins/functions cannot be ported to CSS Custom Properties.
Implement Container Queries: Use @container (min-width: ...) instead of media queries for component-level responsiveness. This ensures components (cards, navbars) react to their parent container, not just the viewport.
Use the :has() Selector:
Utilize for parent styling logic (e.g., styling a form group based on an error message child).
Avoid deep nesting when :has() can flatten the selector structure.
Layout & Positioning:
Use aspect-ratio for media containers instead of the old padding-bottom hack.
Prefer Anchor Positioning (position: anchor) for tooltips and popovers to avoid absolute positioning calculations in JS.
Use Subgrid (grid-template-columns: subgrid) when aligning nested components to parent grid tracks.
Color & Theming:
Use light-dark() function for handling color values to simplify dark mode implementation.
Utilize color-mix() for generating color variations (hover states, alpha transparency) rather than hardcoding hex codes.
Use text-wrap: balance for headlines to prevent widow lines.
Typography:
Use logical properties (margin-inline, padding-block) instead of physical directions (left, right) to better support RTL languages.
Use clamp() for fluid typography instead of multiple media queries.
3. JavaScript Architecture (ES2025+ & Modern Performance)
Temporal API: Replace standard Date object usage with the modern Temporal API for date/time calculations, parsing, and formatting (e.g., blog post dates).
Pattern Matching: (Experimental/Transpilation) Use match statements instead of complex switch/else chains for data validation and component rendering logic.
Error Handling:
Use Error.cause property for error chaining: throw new Error('Failed to load', { cause: originalError }).
Use Error.isError() checks (if supported in target environment) for robust error validation.
Resource Management:
Use using and await using syntax for disposing of resources (stream handles, file connections) if applicable to the backend/build scripts.
Decorators: Apply standard JS/TS decorators (@log, @deprecated) to classes and methods for cross-cutting concerns like logging and deprecation warnings.
Arrays & Iterators:
Use Array.prototype.groupBy() for organizing data lists (e.g., blog posts by year/category) instead of manual reduce loops.
Use Math.sumPrecise() for numerical calculations (e.g., statistics on the site) to avoid floating-point errors.
4. Performance & Accessibility (Perf & A11y)
Rendering Optimization:
Use content-visibility: auto for off-screen sections (like long blog lists) to improve rendering performance.
Use scroll-driven animations (animation-timeline: view()) for scroll effects instead of JS scroll listeners to ensure 60fps performance.
Focus Management:
Always use :focus-visible instead of :focus to show outline rings only for keyboard navigation, keeping mouse interaction clean.
Images:
Use native <img> attributes loading="lazy" and decoding="async".
Prefer AVIF/WebP formats with <picture> elements for art direction.
5. Project Specifics (Assumptions)
Framework Detection: Automatically detect if the project uses Jekyll, Hugo, Astro, or Next.js and adhere to the specific data structure (e.g., Jekyll Front Matter, Astro Props).
SEO: Ensure all pages have unique <title> and <meta name="description"> tags. Use <meta name="theme-color"> for mobile browser bar customization.
