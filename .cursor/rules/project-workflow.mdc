Project Workflow & Organizational Standards
1. Git & Commit Conventions
Commit Messages: Use conventional commits format: type(scope): description.
Types: feat (new feature), fix (bug fix), style (formatting), refactor (code restructuring), docs (documentation).
Example: feat(blog): add dark mode toggle using light-dark()
Branching: Use main (or master) for production. Create feature branches named feature/short-description or fix/short-description.
No Secrets: Never commit API keys, .env files, or sensitive credentials.
2. Documentation Standards
README Maintenance: Keep the root README.md updated with:
Local development setup instructions.
Tech stack versions (e.g., "Node v20", "Jekyll 4.3").
Deployment commands.
Inline Comments: Document complex CSS logic (especially container queries or nested contexts) and JS utility functions directly in the code.
Changelog: Maintain a CHANGELOG.md to track significant updates to the site design or functionality.
3. File Organization
Components: Keep UI components isolated. If using a framework (React/Vue/Astro), group components by feature (e.g., components/blog/, components/layout/).
Assets: Store images in an assets/images/ or public/images/ folder. Use descriptive filenames (kebab-case) like blog-post-cover-2025.jpg instead of img001.jpg.
CSS Architecture:
Prefer component-scoped CSS (CSS Modules, Scoped Styles, or Shadow DOM) over global stylesheets where possible to prevent style leakage.
If using a global CSS file, organize it by section with clear comments: /* === Global Reset === */, /* === Typography === */.
4. Code Quality
Linting: Always run the project's linter (e.g., ESLint, Stylelint) before committing.
Testing: If adding JS logic (like search or filtering), write unit tests using a framework compatible with the stack (e.g., Vitest, Jest).
Spelling: Ensure English content is spell-checked, especially for public-facing headers and navigation items.
5. Deployment
Build Verification: Before pushing to main, run a local build (npm run build or equivalent) to ensure there are no build errors.
Preview: Use GitHub Pages preview or a local server to verify changes before merging.
