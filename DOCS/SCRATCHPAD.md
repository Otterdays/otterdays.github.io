# SCRATCHPAD

**Active:** Project restructure for GitHub Pages optimization.  
**Blockers:** None.

**Last 5 actions:**
1. Restructured project: `assets/` → `css/`, `js/`, `images/` folders
2. Extracted shared theme switcher into `js/theme.js` (removed duplication from 4 files)
3. Extracted badge logic into `js/badges.js` (DRY principle)
4. Added SEO meta tags, Open Graph, Twitter cards to all pages
5. Created custom 404.html page and favicon.svg

**Structural changes (2026-02-04):**
- Created: `css/style.css`, `js/theme.js`, `js/badges.js`, `images/favicon.svg`, `images/placeholder.svg`, `404.html`
- Updated: All HTML files with new paths and SEO tags
- Deleted: `assets/` folder (consolidated into new structure)

**Next steps:** Test all pages locally, commit/push to GitHub, verify GitHub Pages deployment.
