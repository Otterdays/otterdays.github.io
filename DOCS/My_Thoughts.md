# My_Thoughts — Decisions & rationale

- **Static HTML only:** No framework or build step so the site is trivial to host on GitHub Pages and stays fast.
- **No sensitive info:** No email, phone, or API keys in the repo; profile links (e.g. GitHub) only.
- **DOCS in repo:** Per project rules; SCRATCHPAD/SUMMARY/SBOM etc. live under `DOCS/` for handoff and audit.
