## Ideas backlog (QoL, themes, links, everything)

**QoL & polish (2026-02)**
- [ ] **URL tooltips on cards** — Add `title="Open [Name] in new tab → example.com"` to external link cards so users see destination before clicking.
- [ ] **Search hint on hover** — Show "Search site (⌘K)" in tooltip or label when hovering the search button.
- [ ] **Footer stats as links** — "100+ items" opens search; "78+ companies" links to companies.html; "11 pages" links to updates or index.
- [ ] **Section quick-jump** — On long pages (tools, companies, media), floating "Jump to section" dropdown or pill bar to scroll to sections.
- [ ] **"New" badge on recent cards** — Small "New" pill on recently added items (Codeium, Continue, LTX Video, etc.); `data-new` or JS list.
- [ ] **Theme change toast** — Brief "Theme saved" message when switching themes.
- [ ] **Click feedback on cards** — Stronger `:active` state (e.g. scale-down) so clicks feel responsive.
- [ ] **Copy link on card hover** — Small copy icon that copies URL to clipboard; power-user feature.
- [ ] **Staggered card entrance** — `animation-delay: calc(var(--i) * 30ms)` for cards in sections; smoother reveal.
- [ ] **Focus ring animation** — Subtle pulse or glow on `:focus-visible` for keyboard users.
- [ ] **Scroll-to-top feedback** — Brief "↑ Scrolled to top" or similar after clicking scroll-to-top.
- [ ] **Skip links per section** — On long pages, add "Skip to Tools" / "Skip to Companies" etc.
- [ ] **Live region for search** — Announce result count and selection changes to screen readers.

**QoL & UX**
- [ ] **Breadcrumb / "You are here"** — Small text above content: Home → Programs (or current page). Low effort, high clarity.
- [ ] **"Back to top" after long scroll** — You have a scroll-top button; consider showing it only after ~2 screens (Intersection Observer or scroll threshold).
- [ ] **Copy link / Share** — On About or key pages, a "Copy link" or "Share" button (Web Share API with fallback).
- [x] **Print-friendly CSS** — `@media print` to hide sidebar, simplify cards, show URLs so the site is useful when printed.
- [x] **Skip to main content** — `<a href="#main" class="skip-link">Skip to content</a>` + `id="main"` on `<main>` for keyboard/screen-reader users.
- [x] **Focus visible** — Ensure `:focus-visible` is styled on nav, search, theme, cards so keyboard users see where they are.
- [ ] **Theme transition** — Short (e.g. 0.2s) transition on `body` for `background-color` / `color` when switching themes so it doesn’t flash.

**Themes**
- [x] **Auto dark/light** — `prefers-color-scheme` in theme.js; default to system, still allow manual override (localStorage).
- [x] **Theme preview on hover** — In the theme dropdown, hovering an option briefly applies that theme; click to confirm (reduces misclicks).
- [ ] **More themes** — Catppuccin, Tokyo Night, One Dark, Rose Pine; or seasonal (e.g. Halloween, Winter) if you like variety.
- [ ] **Theme transition animation** — As above; smooth flip instead of instant swap.

**Links & content**
- [ ] **About: "How to add a link"** — One short paragraph + link to CONTENT_GUIDE or a short inline checklist (add to HTML, add to search, add company if new).
- [ ] **About: Changelog teaser** — "Recent changes" with 3–5 bullets from CHANGELOG (manual or script). Dedicated Updates page exists; optional teaser on About still possible.
- [x] **Footer: Repo / Edit on GitHub** — Link to GitHub repo (e.g. "Source" or "Edit this page") so devs can find the repo.
- [ ] **Footer: RSS** — If you ever add a blog or "Recently added" feed, an RSS link in the footer.
- [ ] **404: Suggested links** — "Try: Home, Programs, Tools" or a few popular pages so 404 isn’t a dead end.
- [ ] **Programs: repo links** — If projects have GitHub URLs, add a small "Repo" or icon link on each card (optional, only where you have the URL).

**Search & discovery**
- [ ] **"Surprise me!" in search** — Button that picks a random result and navigates (or opens) it; fun and discovery.
- [ ] **Search: filter by category** — Chips or dropdown: All / Chats / Tools / Companies / etc. to narrow results.
- [ ] **Search: recent searches** — Store last 5 queries in localStorage and show "Recent: X, Y" under the input (optional).

**Delight & polish**
- [ ] **Easter egg** — Konami code or a hidden shortcut that does something small (e.g. confetti, theme shuffle, or "Surprise me!").
- [ ] **Card hover micro-animations** — Slight scale or shadow on `.chat-link-card` / `.project-card` hover (you already have this in plans).
- [ ] **Animated favicon** — Favicon that changes with theme or shows a small animation on load (optional; can be distracting).
- [ ] **Staggered entrance** — Stagger delay on cards or sections so the page doesn’t pop in all at once (you have stagger classes; apply to more sections if desired).

**SEO & meta**
- [ ] **JSON-LD** — Person or WebSite schema on index/about so search engines understand the site.
- [ ] **OG image per section** — Different `og:image` for Programs vs Tools vs About (optional; current single image is fine).
- [x] **Sitemap** — `sitemap.xml` listing all 11 pages for crawlers (static list is enough).

**Docs & maintenance**
- [ ] **STYLE_GUIDE: Programs order** — "Keep project cards A–Z by `.project-title`; featured block stays at top."
- [ ] **CONTENT_GUIDE: Programs** — "New project: add card in A–Z order; add to search-data.js; update SCRATCHPAD/CHANGELOG."
- [ ] **Link checker** — Occasional script or CI step to `fetch` key URLs and report broken links (optional).

**Optional biggers**
- [x] **Changelog page** — Done: `updates.html` + `js/updates-data.js`, `js/updates.js`; version badge links to updates.
- [ ] **Dark/light toggle in nav** — In addition to full theme switcher, a single "Dark / Light" flip for quick switch.
- [x] **Collapsible sections on other pages** — Done: collapsible reused on Tools, Specials, Skills, Media via `collapsible.js`.
- [ ] **Quick filter chips on Programs** — Filter by tag (Game, Music, TypeScript, etc.) without leaving the page.
